The clarification was in response to allegations that there was a mismatch between total votes polled and total votes counted on EVMs during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Since May 23, when results of the Lok Sabha election were announced, concerns have been raised that in many constituencies the total number of votes polled (as per the voter turnout figures released by EC) does not match with the votes counted on the result day. These alleged excess votes are termed as 'ghost votes'.Media reports had pointed out that in some constituencies the total votes polled was less than that votes counted on EVMs while in some the votes polled were more than the ones counted on May 23.claimed that its analysis shows that this mismatch was found in 373 Lok Sabha constituencies. The difference in votes, as per this report, ranged between 18,331 additional votes in Tamil Nadu's Kanchipuram seat to 19,776 deficit votes in Tripura West.The Election Commission has now reasoned that the voting percentage data put out by it on its website was only provisional and was thus subject to change. \"The provisional voter turnout data reported on ECI website is only the tentative number of voters and not the final numbers,\" the EC said in a press release.What this means is that the EC is saying the figures it had put as \"final voter turnout\" was actually provisional data. As a result, since the voter turnout data was not final, a mismatch with votes counted on EVM was natural to occur. The Commission has said that data on the final voter turnout will be released soon.\"In earlier elections, it used to take months to collect such authenticated election data from all the returning officers. Even in 2014, it took between two to three months after the declaration of results to collect and collate such data in authenticated form. Due to the innovative IT initiatives taken by the Commission this time, the final data on votes counted has been made available within a few days of declaration of results. The reconciliation of voters' data for all parliamentary constituencies (PCs) have been completed in all states and the Index Forms of all 542 PCs are expected to reach ECI from the returning officers shortly, which after compilation, shall be immediately be made public by the Election Commission.\"\"Therefore it is incorrect inference to find ghost voters when there are none,\" the Election Commission said.Election Commission data shows EVM-VVPAT tally was completely correctLittle evidence to show EVMs can be tampered with on counting day on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download fromAmit Shah joins Modi govt: What may now worry Team Modi-ShahMiss India 2019 organisers blasted for fair-skinned finalists.
