### Intelli-History

A hack to the actual realization of smart/intelligent browsing history. The numerous links/tabs provided in by the browser barely provide any insight to the browsing session and are hard to retrace. Aims to implements a visual, dynamic, interactive force-directed graph which expands and traces the path the user took to reach a particular point while browsing. 

Apart from this, with the inclusion of an interactive web extension, the user is able to select and grab topics(displayed as summaries of paragraphs) according to preference/relevance. These preferences are stored in the same stack/storage for the entire session and the user has an option of downloading a ppt/pdf by the end of it containing the summary of sort of the session.

At the end the user has a custom-made(according to selections) or automated summary of the entire browsing session centered around a point topic. All the user has to do is start recording the session with a single click button!   

**Features**
* A chrome-extension for interactive selection of headings, sub-headings for integration with the summary
* Choice to download a ppt/pdf of the topic 
* Recording the session with a single switch
* Topic modeling: inputs a word and displays the visual context of topics associated with the search
* Option of generating automated summary in case of shortage of time
